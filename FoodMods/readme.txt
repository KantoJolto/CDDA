This mod specifically upgrades the food selection found in the grocery stores and in lesser part the pharmacies.
Also adds little debbie-themed treats to stores and zombie corpse drops. 
Includes my previous cereal mod, which allows you to combine cereal and milk for the ultimate in breakfast enjoyment [and lets you make milk from nuts that never spoils, and allows you to make healthier cereal]
